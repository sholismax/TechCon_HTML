            TechCon 2024 is a three-day gathering for builders, researchers, and leaders who shape the future of technology. Founded in 2012 as a regional developer meetup, the conference has grown into an international forum where engineers, product teams, startup founders, and policy makers share practical knowledge, showcase new ideas, and build partnerships that last.

            Over the years TechCon expanded from a single-track event for a few hundred attendees into a hybrid conference with workshops, hands-on labs, and satellite events around the world. Key milestones include the introduction of hands-on workshops in 2016, global expansion in 2019, and a hybrid format in 2023 that welcomed thousands of participants and launched a scholarship program to increase access.

        The mission of TechCon is to accelerate thoughtful innovation by connecting people across disciplines, amplifying underrepresented voices, and sharing actionable practices that teams can use immediately. The conference focuses on education, open collaboration, diversity and inclusion, and responsible technology—practical pillars that guide programming and community initiatives.
        Past speakers have included senior engineers, leading researchers, and founders who bring real-world experience and clear takeaways. Notable presenters have covered topics like reliable system design, responsible AI, product design for impact, and confronting model bias in production systems. These sessions balance big-picture strategy with technical depth, making the conference useful to both individual contributors and decision makers.
